# NOTE: incompatible_enable_cc_toolchain_resolution is set by default on Bazel
# versions 7.0+, see https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7260.
#
# emsdk documentation asks to set this flag (see
# https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk/blob/main/bazel/README.md). And even
# though things seem to work even without this flag, given that this flag
# enables improved Bazel C++ toolchain resolution method that became the
# default in newer Bazel version and does not cause problems, we keep it.
